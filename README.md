# My Respository

Files are separated in two sections:
1. Icons contains all images used on the the pages.
2. src contains data prepared to make quizes and admin panel work properly.
3. quizesDBbackup.sql is the backup of the dedicated database for quizes.

I highly recommend to set those files in the main folder of the side.
Files contained in /src/ are refering to index.html which has been located in main folder.
In code you can find links to "../../index.html".

If there will be any trouble with implementing that - feel free to reach me out :)
